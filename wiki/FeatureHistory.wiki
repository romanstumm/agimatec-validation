version 0.9.1-SNAPSHOT - r212
  * compatible with validation-api-1.0.Beta4.jar

09.04.2009
----------
version 0.9.0-snapshot - r211
  * compatible with latest version of validation-api.jar (beta4-snapshot)

19.02.2009
----------
version 0.7.3-snapshot
  * SVN URL of validation api classes has moved to 
    http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/hibernate/beanvalidation/trunk/validation-api
  * agimatec-validation made compatible with current state of JSR303 validation-api


03.02.2009
----------
  * renamed bootstrap classes of validation-api.jar supported
  * Default-!BuildInConstraint Configuration for standard Annotations (!NotNull, Null, Max, Size...) implemented. Thus javax.validation.constraint annotations will also be validated automatically.

*November 2008:
The reference implementation and JSR303 specification is rapidly changing at the moment.
Check out the svn-sources to get the code compatible with the current state of the validation-api.*

V0.7.3 (snapshot): (Jan 2009)
  * compatible with validation-api (snapshot 4tn feb. 2009), many classes have been renamed
  * validates all javax.validation.constraints that currently exist in the validation-api
   (see resource defaultConstraints.properties in agimatec-validation.jar)
  * not-yet-implemented: !OverridesParameter, !TraversableResolver, !ValidatorContext, group inheritance, type-safety check calling !ConstraintValidator 

V0.7.1 (snapshot): (Nov. 2008)
  * compatible with validation-api.jar (snapshot 24th november 2008)
   - the interfaces and classes of the specificiation changed their names quite often since release 0.7-SNAPSHOT
  * using javax.validation/validation-api from reference implementation
  * implementing proposed bootstrap APIs
  * dropped support for proprietary bootstrap classes 
  * implementing current functionality from jsr303-spec draft
  * package redesign
  * javax.validation.!ConstraintContext support implemented
  * composed constraints implemented (currently without !OverridesParameter!)
  * support for nested properties (needs improvement!)

V0.6.1:
  * Implemented issue-6: Provide a bootstrap method for Validator with specific Locale
  * Implemented issue-7: Provide annotation @Email
  * Implemented issue-8: Maven surefire 2.4.2 version in pom.xml

V0.5:
  * support for resolution of association types during runtime. (required by JSR303)
    consequences: relationship targets can have different types, generics on collection types not required anymore
  * !ValidationContext and !GroupValidationContext are interfaces
  * new testcase !ValidationTest.testValidAnnotation() tests nested, polimorphic relationships  
V0.4:
  * implementation of [http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/edr/jsr303/ JSR 303: bean-validation]
  * Define constraints with predefined annotations
  * Create own validators and annotations to define custom constraints
  * Use annotations on business objects (POJOs, value-object classes)
  * Flexible meta data model can be used for various purposes (see class !MetaBean)
  * Decorate classes and define validators with XML on multiple layers of your application
  * Support for dynamic creation of !MetaBeans (e.g. role-specific validation rules for different users, administration/change of meta data during runtime)
  * A class can have more than one definition of validations (multiple !MetaBeans per class identified by IDs)
  * Load the XML descriptors from any resource (classpath, URL/webservice, database), create own loaders (see interface XMLMetaBeanLoader and XMLMetaBeanRegistry)
  * Generate JSON code (based on a freemarker template) from the meta data (e.g. use meta data in AJAX GUIs to support validation or create a generic GUI for your beans - this framework provides the basis for such solutions) 
  * parameter validation: validation of method-calls (e.g. tested with XFire, call the class !ThreadBeanValidator from within a custom org.codehaus.xfire.service.invoker.Invoker)
