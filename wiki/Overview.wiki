= Introduction =

The Wiki of "agimatec-validation" is open for community contribution. Useful information will be eventually incorporated into other parts of this site. Please be careful not to overwrite content from other people! 

== 29.10.2008: Reference implementation and bootstrap proposal are out ==
  * see http://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?t=991154 
The agimatec-validation framework supports them (check out source from SVN), but
there is more work to be done...
  * The upcoming version 0.7 will not contain the javax.validation classes anymore but  instead use them from the official reference implementation.
  * The upcoming version 0.7 will implement the bootstrap API and thus will not support ValidationProvider and ValidationProviderFactory anymore
  * The version 0.7 will have packages renamed from com.agimatec.utility.validation to com.agimatec.validation
