  * The agimatec-validation framework is older than the JSR 303 specification, but the similarities were striking so that the adaption to the standard was possible withing a short time. For things to be done refer to FeatureRequests.

  * The specification is in beta state and subject to change.

  * Please verify that the version of validation-api.jar you are using
  is compatible with agimatec-validation.jar

  * You can use the framework with the JSR303 interfaces if you want to strictly use the standard.
