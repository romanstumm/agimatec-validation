  * You can find features and news at FeatureHistory.

  * For things to be done refer to FeatureRequests.

  * JSR303 specification is stable (since Oct 2009)

  * The base of the agimatec-validation framework is older than the JSR 303 specification.  JSR303 support could be built on top of the core framework.

  * Please verify that the version of validation-api.jar you are using
  is compatible with agimatec-jsr303.jar and agimatec-validation.jar

  * You can use the framework with the JSR303 interfaces if you want to strictly use the standard.
  Refer to classes in packages javax.validation and com.agimatec.validation.jsr303
  
  or you can access the proprietary APIs of agimatec-validation for additional features.
  Refer to class !MetaBeanManagerFactory, !BeanValidator and !ThreadBeanValidator.
