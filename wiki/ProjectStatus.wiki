#summary Project status and history

= Project status and history =

  * The agimatec-validation framework is older than the JSR 303 specification, but the similarities were striking so that the adaption to the standard was possible withing a short time.  There are still things to be done...

  * The specification is still in a early draft state and subject to change. This implementation will change as soon as the specification is stable.

  * The classes in javax.validation will be removed as soon as they are available from official sites.

  * You can use the framework with the JSR303 interfaces if you want to strictly use the standard.
