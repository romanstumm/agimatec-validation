  * The agimatec-validation framework is older than the JSR 303 specification, but the similarities were striking so that the adaption to the standard was possible withing a short time. 

  * You can find features and news at FeatureHistory.

  * For things to be done refer to FeatureRequests.

  * The specification is stable now (since Oct 2010)

  * Please verify that the version of validation-api.jar you are using
  is compatible with agimatec-validation.jar

  * You can use the framework with the JSR303 interfaces if you want to strictly use the standard.
  Refer to classes in packages javax.validation and com.agimatec.validation.jsr303
  
  or you can access the proprietary APIs of agimatec-validation for additional features.
